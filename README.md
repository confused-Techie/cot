# CoT - Catalog of Things

CoT's goals as an application are somewhat lofty.
With every persons data generally being all digital now, what happens with the data that came before it?
Such as photographs or photo booth printouts?
Or what happens to media that's still largely physical? Such as paystubs or event tickets.

This is where CoT aims to be the solution. Where after digitizing these pieces of media
they can then be imported into CoT.

CoT then aims to help users catalog these physical turned digital items.
Where CoT's priority is in the act of deriving metadata and inserting metadata about the content,
rather than viewing or consuming it.

Once CoT has been used to add metadata into an item this item could then be exported to other platforms
with it's metadata intact.

Metadata CoT strives to utilize:
  - [ ] Scan Date
  - [ ] Back of Document
  - [ ] OCR of text on items
  - [ ] Facial Recognition of People in Photos

Metadata CoT strives to ensure is accessible within it's interface:
  - [ ] Geolocation
  - [ ] Date & Time
  - [ ] Content Tags
  - [ ] People
  - [ ] Notes
